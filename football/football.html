<img src="football/images/football1.png" alt="" width="70%" height="70%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">

The calendar shows the bookings for each of these quarters. If you want to book half the ground, then you must mention which of these quarters you need. This arrangement is designed to maximize participation by allowing to book a quarter of the ground. All bookings will be done at a first-mail-first-served basis. <text style='color:red'>Booking for a slot can be done at most 7 days in advance and at least by 5 PM the day before</text>. Mails sent beyond this window of your requested slot will be ignored.
