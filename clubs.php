				<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Activities</h2>
				<p>Activities we organize are: Treks, Hikes, Mountain biking trips, Mountaineering workshops, Half-marathon. Treks are organized in each semester during the mid-semester recess as well as during the summer vacations. Mountain Biking is organized in even semester mid semester recess. As it is true for any sport, physical fitness is of prime importance. Hence, the club organizes conditioning camp of around 40 days. It also helps to increase willpower to forgo the pleasure of early morning sleep which is a big plus on the expedition as it is always advisable to start early. More emphasis is placed on completing the course of the exercises than just becoming a super athlete. The training schedule ensures that the individual attains the minimum requirement for the activity.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align:justify;">About Us</h2>
				<p>Shooting Club at IIT Kanpur is one of a kind to feed your craving of perfection. A very new club, it was formed with the sole objective of uncovering the best and the brightest assets among the campus community who share the passion of perfection.<br>Shooting originated as a means of survival, and it was practiced in order to hunt. After the Industrial Revolution, shooting evolved into an elite sport. It is predominantly a skill-based sport where consistency, accuracy, and concentration are key features over one particular body type. There are 2 categories in shooting sports, 1. Pistol: Short firearms held with one unsupported hand in a standing position. Different pistols used for different events e.g. air pistols that use compressed air to discharge lead pellets, rapid fire pistols in which 5 pellets are shot in quick succession and traditional or free pistols which shoot one pellet at a time. 2. Rifles: Shoulder firearms. Air rifles use compressed air to discharge lead pellets. Rifles are fired in either a prone, standing, or kneeling position depending on the event, and the “three position” events incorporate all three.</p>

			<h2>Taekwondo</h2>

			<div class="divider-new2">
				<h2 style="text-align:justify;">About Us</h2>
				<p>Taekwondo, a form of Martial Arts, originated in Korea. It is not just a game or sport, it is an art which can build confidence, enhance self-esteem, teach self-defence, develop discipline and strengthen mind, body and soul.<br>This form of Martial Arts helps in attaining peace and body control through different patterns of demonstration (called Poomsae) leading to harmony in the body. At its core, Taekwondo is about learning to diffuse situations. The practice is defensive, rather than offensive. What you learn in Taekwondo training can prevent you from becoming a victim in threatening situations. These fundamental skills increase your physical coordination, flexibility, balance, and mental acumen. The aim of TKD club is to develop and continuously maintain a well-rounded planned series of future events and provide the finest quality in martial art in family-oriented environment to show their skills beyond the classroom. Our main focus is to provide the best physical fitness, competitive atmosphere to be absorbed as a sport and self-defence specific skill, which may come handy in times of trouble. Anyone (UG, PG, PhD, RA - M/F) who has enough motivation to learn and sweat up through the seasons is more than welcome to join us.

			<h2>Boxing Hobby Group</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="modal-body">
			<div class="divider-new2">
				<h2 style="text-align:justify;">About Us</h2>
				<p>General health and athletic conditioning: The one most obvious benefit of boxing is that it’s a great form of cardiovascular exercise. It improves stamina to a great extent and helps burning body fat, thus lending you a lean, fit body naturally. Cardio kick boxing workouts allow you to burn out 350 to 500 calories in just an hour. Moreover, boxing drills help improve reflexes and strength.<br>Focus: Boxing isn’t as much a sport of power as it is of tactics. Knowing when and where to strike often overcomes any lack of physical prowess. You learn how to fix your eyes on a moving target, which combination of punches to go for, all the while trying to evade strikes from the opponent. Sometimes, you have to be patient, gauge the opponent acutely, lure him into making a mistake, and then hit him on the counter. At times, boxing becomes a game of chess-albeit a more physically demanding one. Rage and Serenity: It’s fun to hit the heavy bag as hard as you can. But boxing isn’t a show of strength. Many a time, it’s important to throw lighter, quicker punches, because the harder you punch, the faster you’ll be fatigued. At times, boxing is about curbing the urge to go all out, and thinking smart. Thus, you learn to tame your mind to your will. You learn to achieve the point between rage and serenity.</p>

				<p>“When the spirits are low, when the day appears dark, when work becomes monotonous, when hope hardly seems worth having, just mount a bicycle and go out for a spin down the road, without thought on anything but the ride you are taking.” Sherlock Holmes author, Arthur Conan Doyle, Scientific American, 1896. Bicycling hobby group helps you to make that easier.</p>
