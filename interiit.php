				<h3 class="animateColumn">Inter IIT Sports Meet</h3>
				<h4 class="animateColumn">The Inter IIT Sports Meet is the annual sports tournament of the Indian Institutes of Technology. It is organized in December every year, with the Aquatics events held separately in October. The seven old IITs - IIT Bombay, IIT Delhi, IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Roorkee and IIT Guwahati - take turns hosting the event. Inter IIT Sports Meet (or just Inter IIT, as students of the IITs call it) is the one of the rare events wherein all the IITs participate.
				<br><br>
				Tournaments are held in 13 different sports, namely: Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Cricket, Football, Hockey, Lawn Tennis, Squash, Swimming, Table Tennis, Volleyball, Water Polo, Weightlifting.
				<br><br>
				As the Inter-IIT Rule Book notes, the main objective of Inter IIT Sports Meet is “to organize sports competitions in some selected Olympics-recognized events, to encourage sportsmanship, to promote and create a better harmony, understanding and friendly interaction among the students of the IITs as well as to foster a close association among them”.
				<br><br>
It also goes on add, “to make students aware of the importance of sports and games in a modern era, to help students perform skillfully in all life situations and also raise the standard of sports in IIT’s.”</h4>
				<!--<h4 class="animateColumn">Inter-IIT Sports Meet is the most eagerly looked after sports event amongst campus teams, wherein all IITs compete for glory. It comprises of two meets, Inter IIT Main Meet in December and Inter IIT Aquatics Meet. Aquatics Meet is held separately (generally in the first week of October) as part of Inter IIT each year preceding the main meet. Inter IIT is hosted by IITs turn by turn. General Championship is awarded to the teams based on their combined performance in Inter IIT Main Meet and Inter IIT Aquatics meet. IIT Madras hosted the Inter IIT 2017 edition. The grandness of the event can be judged by the fact that the teams practice throughout the year to give their best shot in a 10 day tournament.</h4>-->

				<h3 class="animateColumn">A Brief History</h3>
				<h4 class="animateColumn">The proposition for an Inter IIT Sports Meet was brought up in 1961, and IIT Bombay hosted the first ever Inter IIT Sports Meet. Only five IITs were in existence then, namely IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Kanpur and IIT Delhi; who competed in five sports only.
				<br><br>
				The Meet in 1971 was cancelled due to the India-Pakistan war, while the one in 1992 was to be held at IIT Bombay but was cancelled owing to the communal riots in Mumbai. The 2015 meet that was supposed to be held at IIT Madras was washed out due to unpredictable rains.

			<div class="container animateColumn">
				<h3 class="animateColumn">Format</h3>
				<h4 class="animateColumn">Each sport carries 10 points for the winners, 6 for the runners up, 4 for the 3rd place and 2 for the 4th place. Total points for a particular IIT are summed up and the total is known as their GC tally. The IIT with maximum GC tally wins the Inter IIT Sports meet, and gets to lift the prestigious GC trophy. The dream of every member of the contingent is to perform to their best of abilities at the prestigious Inter IIT tournament and contribute to bringing the GC home. IIT Kanpur has been winning the overall General Championship for the past three years. We are looking up to <b>#MissionMadras.</b></h4>
